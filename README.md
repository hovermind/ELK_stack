## Elastic search
Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time. It is generally used as the underlying engine/technology that powers applications that have complex search features and requirements.

Logstash: collect, parse, analyze, aggregate log data & then feed this data into Elasticsearch

Percolator: create query, when data changes, the query will be run and if criteria matched, alert will be shown
